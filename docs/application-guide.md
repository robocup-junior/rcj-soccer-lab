# RCJ Soccer Lab — application guide

Interactive 3D rule explanations, referee practice, and optional referee
certification for RoboCupJunior Soccer. It works with the 2026 rules and with
the 2027 draft, and compares them. The application works as a full training
tool and as a small iframe embedded directly beside a rule.

Application: <https://robocup-junior.github.io/rcj-soccer-lab/>

## What is included

- A PlayCanvas 3D field generated from one auditable 2026 specification file.
- Rules-correct continuous carpet, inward boundary stripes, rounded penalty
  areas, neutral spots, matte walls/goals, and ball-return wedges with flat goal
  pockets.
- Six deterministic, frame-scrubbable rule situations.
- A full **Rules** reader covering six official documents and 259 navigation
  entries, including appendices and footnotes.
- 32 additional gameplay animations with timelines, camera choices and questions,
  plus interactive inspection, kicker, field, ball and scoring workbenches.
- Six main tabs: **Rules**, **Play**, **Referee**, **Version comparison**,
  **Video replay**, and **Academy**.
- A **Rules version** selector for the 2026 rules and the 2027 draft. It
  switches the official text, the situation library, the field markings and the
  referee engine together; see [Rules versions](#rules-versions).
- Optional device-local profiles, portable progress backups, GitHub-confirmed referee
  numbers, game history/averages, and an opt-in signed training-referee directory.
- Complete English, Slovak, German, and Japanese interface/catalogue support,
  including generated match feedback, referee reviews, quizzes, and embeds.
- A situation library combining 111 decision exercises (133 under the 2027
  draft), guided replays,
  technical/safety/administration questions and
  detailed studies with their matching official sections, questions and saved
  completion checks.
- A Play mode with live 2v2 matches, manual driving, local human-vs-human play,
  autonomous teams, and a scoreboard with timed games and automatic kickoffs.
- Referee AI match practice with 35 shuffled incidents, scored calls, real
  removals and return timers, goals, placements, restarts and replay.
- Multiple camera presets plus free orbit/zoom.
- Selectable XLC Open 2020, XLC Innovation 2021, and lightweight proxy robot
  visuals, with camera-facing team labels and overhead numbers.
- A scored referee rubric that can accept legitimate discretion.
- A deterministic single-owner ball system: the 42 mm ball stays at one stable
  robot-relative attachment point and changes to free motion only at an authored
  release.
- An engine-independent scenario format in `lib/simulator`.
- A development `window.snapshot()` hook for automated inspection.

Ball attachment is a visual teaching aid, not a certificate that a physical
robot complies with the rules. The legal example releases the ball during a
challenge; the illegal-holding example deliberately does not. Observable facts
and referee judgments intentionally remain separate.

Animated questions and detailed studies first show the observable situation and
stop at the decision point, before the referee's correction. Choose an answer to
see the explanation. In practice, **Watch explained replay** opens the guided
walkthrough first and records the answer as assisted. Question choices are
shuffled without changing their grading. Text checks, animated questions, detailed
studies and referee cases share the same result banner and answer icons.

The placement checks explicitly distinguish moving the ball from moving a robot,
nearest from furthest unoccupied neutral spots, and the procedure when a repeated
**lack of progress** call is needed.

## Run on localhost

On Windows, double-click `Start-RCJ-Soccer-Lab.cmd`. It starts the simulator,
opens <http://localhost:3000/>, and keeps the server running until Enter is
pressed in the launcher window.

For a normal development terminal:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The local embed form also works, for example:

```text
http://localhost:3000/?embed=legal-dribbler-backspin&robot=xlc-innovation-2021
```

Validation commands:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test:match
pnpm test:rules
pnpm test:referee
pnpm test:learning
pnpm test:certification
pnpm test:github
pnpm test:i18n
pnpm lint
pnpm build
```

## Local two-player matches

In **Play**, choose **Human vs human**, then **Start match**. Both players use
the same computer and keyboard; each drives one robot with an AI teammate
defending. This is local multiplayer, not an online matchmaking service.

| Action            | Player 1 — Blue | Player 2 — Yellow |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| Drive / strafe    | W A S D         | Arrow keys        |
| Turn left / right | Q / E           | Comma / period    |
| Kick              | Space           | Enter             |
| Switch teammate   | C               | Slash             |

Movement is relative to the robot. **P** pauses both players and **R** resets
the match. Each player also has an on-screen driving pad and an independent
Dribbler switch. Clicking the field restores keyboard control after changing a
setting; leaving the browser tab pauses play and clears held inputs. Existing
solo WASD/arrow controls and Arrange mode remain available. Play matches do not
count as referee-certification attempts.

## RefMate-style referee controls

In **Referee**, choose **RefMate controls** (the default) or **Classic controls**.
Changing the layout keeps the current match, penalties and certification attempt.
**Match settings** jumps to the existing practice-mode and duration controls.

The training console is inspired by the open-source
[RCJ Soccer RefMate app](https://github.com/robocup-junior/soccer-referee-app)
(Apache-2.0, reviewed at commit `cafef25ed9e58de2fcd659f413b2be59c57d8e3d`).
This is an independently implemented simulator interface, not a Bluetooth
controller or an official replacement for the hardware app.

- A1/A2 map to Blue 1/2; B1/B2 map to Yellow 1/2. Tile colors indicate status,
  not team: blue during setup, green while playing, red while stopped/penalized.
- Select **out of bounds** or **damaged** as the penalty reason. Tap a robot to
  select it, then double-tap to remove it; double-tap a benched robot to return it.
  Double-tap a score to award that team a goal. Single-tap activation is optional.
  Keyboard Enter/Space and the smaller selected-robot buttons activate once.
- **START/STOP** beside the clock is an ungraded training pause/resume.
  **START ALL ROBOTS / STOP ALL ROBOTS** records a referee signal. Select
  kickoff or same-position resume explicitly. Arranging kickoff positions and
  signalling kickoff remain separate actions.
- The four penalty countdowns use simulation time, not wall-clock time. Expiry
  does not automatically return a robot, and START/STOP ALL does not clear its
  penalty. Return permission still belongs to the referee; Continuous mode
  accepts mistaken removals and premature returns and assesses them afterward.
- **Other referee calls** retains field decisions, pushed-out waivers,
  relocations, inspection and corrections. The category selector exposes all
  remaining actions. Calls from both layouts use the same scoring and replay
  path, with no assessment-policy or recording-format changes.

These differences from the physical RefMate app are deliberate training
adaptations. Links are simulated, no radio commands are transmitted, and a
stopped robot can receive a penalty during a Step-mode teaching pause. The
controls and guidance are available in all four interface languages; hardware
START/STOP labels, robot IDs and official rules terminology stay recognizable.

## GitHub-only training certification

The whole app is a static Vite/React application on GitHub Pages. It does not use
ChatGPT authentication, a Sites backend, a paid server, or a runtime AI service.
Guest Rules, Play, Referee, all robot models and interactive embeds still work.

**Local profile** saves progress and game history in IndexedDB on this device.
This is not a private online login. Export/import a progress backup to move
between devices. Clearing site data deletes local progress unless backed up.
Use a nickname; no email or password is requested. Creating a local profile
does not automatically publish anything.

**Connect through GitHub** prepares an issue. The user signs in on GitHub itself,
submits the issue, returns to the academy and checks its signed result. The
actual GitHub issue author—not a name or ID supplied by the browser—determines
the stable `RCJ-GH-<numeric GitHub ID>` referee number. The app never requests
a GitHub access token or stores passwords. This public connection is not a
private session, a legal identity check or proof of who is operating the device.

All GitHub submissions are public: GitHub username, chosen alias, optional
country, and (for certification) answers and game action logs. Directory listing
is opt-in and independent from that unavoidable public submission history.
Changing an already-published alias/country/listing requires another connect
submission. Opting out removes the current directory listing, not Git history
or the original public issues. Do not put children's private information here.

A 2026 round requires:

- All 111 rule questions, with at least 106 correct on the first recorded answer.
- Five complete 10-minute Step games at 90% or better, from at most eight starts.
- Two complete 10-minute Continuous games at 80% or better, from at most five starts.

New rounds use assessment policy v4. Existing v3 rounds retain their original
105 assigned questions and require at least 100 correct first answers; updates
do not reset that progress or add six questions halfway through a round.

Hints, reference panes and explained replays are hidden until an answer is
recorded during certification. Text and animated questions and detailed studies
lock after the first answer; their explanations can still be reviewed afterward.
Case exercises may need several decisions to finish a procedure, but retries do
not replace an earlier wrong answer. Every game start consumes a
local attempt. Full restarts are unlimited and reset all round evidence together,
while keeping practice history and previous round summaries. Seeds are assigned
deterministically from round ID, mode and attempt number to prevent reusing the
same game recording in several attempt slots.

Certification uses versioned assessment policy and replay evidence. Robot models
are locked for an attempt, percentages are compared before rounding, and rule
decisions are checked against the exact situation that was shown. The first
recorded answer remains the first answer even after replaying a lesson.

Active certification games save checkpoints on this device. Resume the same
attempt from Academy after leaving or refreshing. Completed Continuous games have
a read-only decision timeline and replay; Step games have a saved assessment
summary. Saves can be retried after a storage error. Export
a backup before clearing site data or changing browsers. Checkpoints are not cloud
sync, and abrupt browser/device shutdown can lose the most recent unsaved seconds.

New examinations use `rcj-soccer-2026-v4`; v3 rounds remain supported with their
original question set. Both use replay engine `referee-match-2026-v3`. Unfinished
v1/v2 rounds are read-only and require an explicit fresh-round restart.
Existing practice history, older evidence in backups,
and previously signed certificates are preserved; older recordings are not
silently regraded using the new engine.

The assessment covers main 2v2 Soccer, including 38 source-linked knowledge
questions. It is not comprehensive Entry/SuperTeam or tournament-organizer
qualification. The opponent-pushed robot return and out-carrier subsequent-goal
decisions retain the committee training policy requested for this app and are
labelled separately from published rule wording. A 10-minute training game is not
a full official two-half match, and Step-mode teaching pauses intentionally differ
from live refereeing. The planar simulator does not simulate ball height.

Local success means **Ready for verification**, not certified. The final issue
contains a gzip-compressed evidence packet. The reviewer runs trusted
default-branch code in a bounded, secret-free process, regrades canonical rule
answers and replays the actual fixed-tick game decisions. Claimed accuracy and
summary counters do not determine eligibility. Only the publisher possesses
the signing private key in a GitHub Actions secret. Public pages verify ECDSA
P-256 signatures and directory hashes against the bundled public key.

This is a **mock/training credential**, not an official RoboCup appointment.
It raises the barrier above editing a browser score or unsigned table, but is
unproctored: a determined programmer can fabricate consistent answer/action
evidence, automate the public engine, alter local first-answer history or choose
a new round. Replay validation proves consistency, not honest human participation.
Repository administrators who can change the verifier or trusted public key are
also trusted issuers. Do not use this as high-stakes identity or anti-cheat proof.

## GitHub operations and limits

See [the operator guide](github-academy.md) for setup, trust boundaries,
recovery and capacity testing. The application code is on `main`; signed public
records are on the separate `academy-data` branch. A batch publisher handles
open submissions and retries interrupted work without losing queued issues.
The directory reads 16 static shards—not 10,000 per-user API calls.

This targets zero hosting subscription cost on a public GitHub repository using
standard runners, **within GitHub's policies and quotas**. It is not a promise
of unlimited traffic, zero future cost or no maintenance. GitHub's Actions
permitted-use restrictions still apply to this experimental publication workflow;
seek GitHub confirmation before operating it as a large production credential
service. Review dependencies, rule changes, runner usage and availability.

## Languages

Use the language menu in the top-right corner. The selection is stored locally
and carried in `?lang=en`, `?lang=sk`, `?lang=de`, or `?lang=ja` through modes,
deep links, robot changes, and copied iframe embeds. Browser language is used
the first time the app opens without an explicit selection.

Rule-defined calls such as **Out of bounds**, **Damaged robot**, **Pushing**,
**Multiple defense**, and **Lack of progress** intentionally remain in their
official English wording. Exact official quotations and the cross-origin live
rulebook remain English; surrounding explanations and controls are translated.
The in-app translations are learning aids and do not replace the official
English source.

The checked-in runtime catalogue has no translation-service dependency. After
adding or changing authored English copy, maintainers can refresh it with:

```bash
pnpm i18n:generate
```

Machine-generated rule explanations should receive native-speaker committee
review before being treated as publication-ready wording.

Every push to `main` is also type-checked, statically exported, and deployed
to GitHub Pages by `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`. Local development uses the same static application.

## Play simulated games

Open **Play** in the top bar, or visit `/?mode=play`. Select **You vs AI** to
drive Blue 1 with an AI teammate against two opponents; **AI vs AI** lets both
teams play. Each team can also be set to manual with an AI teammate,
autonomous, or stationary. Picking any robot takes manual control of its team;
only one robot is directly driven at a time. Start the match to begin.

- **WASD / arrow keys:** robot-relative forward, backward, and sideways motion.
- **Q / E:** turn left / right. **Space:** kick a ball directly in front.
- **C:** switch to the other robot on the selected team.
- **P:** pause / resume. **R:** reset the match and score.
- The on-screen buttons can also be held, including on a touchscreen.

The manual robot's dribbler can be switched off. Match length is 1, 2, or 5
minutes; changing it resets the match. Input clears when paused, when switching
robots or control modes, or when the window loses focus. Backgrounding the page
pauses the game. Switching tabs pauses and preserves the current match.

Use **Arrange field** to drag robots or the ball, enter coordinates, rotate
robots, or choose an existing lesson layout. Start the match directly from
that arrangement. Arrow keys move the selected object 1 cm (5 cm with Shift),
Q/E rotate, and **Reset layout** restores the arrangement before editing.
The legacy `/?mode=manual` link opens this editor inside Play.

Play uses an independent 120 Hz planar model with swept robot collisions,
ball contact and damping, kicks, and goal-panel collisions. A goal counts when
the ball contacts the inside back wall. Goals restart automatically; stalled
AI play moves the ball to the nearest neutral spot after 8 seconds. This is a
practice game, without ball height, ramp physics, or automatic referee
penalties. Scripted rule lessons are in Rules; manual arrangement and live
driving share the Play field.

## Referee the AI teams

Open **Referee** in the top bar, select **Referee AI match** from Play, or open
`/?mode=referee`. The legacy `/?mode=play&referee=1` link still works. Both teams
play autonomously. Press **Whistle** (Space)
when you want to make a call, select the affected robot where relevant, and
choose your action. Goal buttons identify the scoring team directly. **P**
pauses playback. Other actions are available through the action-category menu.

**Match setup** offers **Step** and **Continuous** modes, a 1/3/5/10-minute
training match, and multiple topic checkboxes. Apply these with **Start new
match with these settings**. Step keeps the guided decision pauses and authored
drills. Continuous never stops for an uncalled incident: robots can touch the
wall and drive back, goals bounce back into play, and penalties still require
the referee. **Pause for decision** / Space freezes all actors, the ball,
reaction windows and training time until you act or resume.

Continuous accepts every referee decision exactly as entered. A wrong target is
removed, a premature placement still moves the ball, a goal is awarded to the
chosen team, and a benched robot can be returned immediately even when it is not
eligible. The trainer does not reveal or block on correctness during the match;
the referee may make additional corrective decisions and then resume the actual
resulting game state.

Continuous faults steer real robots through normal physics; they never load
an authored layout. Out-of-bounds, damage/fire, multiple defense, pushing,
stalled play and scoring opportunities are encouraged according to selected
topics. Restarts and return requests follow actual match events. Administrative
exercises remain available in Step. Natural incidents outside the selection
remain actionable but do not affect that session's accuracy.

Both modes finish with correct, wrong, missed and assisted totals plus accuracy
by topic: correct / (correct + wrong + missed). One situation counts once;
retries cannot recover first-attempt credit. Assisted work is excluded from
unaided accuracy. Continuous mode allows eight seconds for a persistent robot
penalty/goal and a short reaction window after positional contact clears;
uncalled discretionary pushing alone is not a missed violation. Full time
excludes new incidents with less than three seconds to react. **End match & see
results** also ends a session explicitly. Pauses themselves earn no points. At
full time, Continuous provides a chronological decision timeline containing the
actual call, expected call, physical effect and relevant rule. Missed calls are
placed at the moment the incident appeared, and every row can seek a detached
full-match replay of the game as it was actually refereed.

A visible count can start after one sustained second of little ball movement,
without guessing the later automatic stall detector. This is a permissive
training threshold, not a rulebook timeout. Placement still requires the full
illustrative count; resumed progress cancels it without a missed decision.

There are 35 authored situations spanning scoring, pushing and multiple defense,
lack of progress, out of bounds, ball movement, damaged robots and returns,
kickoffs, interference, stoppages and match checks. The shuffle visits every
case before repeating, with random delays, reflected layouts and swapped teams.
Legal situations are mixed in. The **Practice setup & coverage** panel shows
what you have encountered, lets you choose a drill or skip the gap before the
next incident, and provides a seed for repeating or changing the sequence.

In Step mode, normal AI play runs between drills. Live back-wall contacts, out-of-bounds
events and stalled play are held for assessment; whistling also evaluates live
pushing and multiple-defense geometry. Authored evidence stops before the
lesson's referee action and hides its answer captions. Observation notes
supply facts such as a reported power failure or unauthorized human contact.
Replay preserves the last situation, including its lead-up and decision
endpoint, without changing the live match. Rule links open the matching
section inside Rules; returning to Referee keeps the paused match.

In Step mode, correct calls apply to the match: remove robots with their motors
off, move the ball or the relevant defender to a clear neutral spot,
award/disallow goals, correct setups and restart play. Wrong calls leave the
guided drill unchanged and explain the rule and target to reconsider. Retrying
does not recover first-try credit. Accepted discretionary choices are labelled
**Supported referee judgment**. Combined infringements require successive
decisions using the updated ball position. Continuous instead applies every
submitted call and defers its explanation to the post-match review.

Benched robots stay absent from AI, collisions and new drills. Their penalty
starts at removal; normal play continues and return requires your permission,
readiness, time/kickoff eligibility and a clear neutral spot. The trainer
simulates repair completion after a short interval. Returning robots face
their own goal. Speed controls scale simulated play and penalty time together.

Decision reviews and authored evidence are training pauses: no match or bench
time is charged while studying them. The visible lack-of-progress count is a
teaching example, not a universal three-second rule. Holding inspection and
retrieving a ball kicked out use explicitly labelled exercise procedures where
the rule does not specify one mandatory restart. This covers the main Soccer
match situations; it does not claim to adjudicate every possible physical,
administrative or discretionary circumstance, or replace event officials.

The pure controller and case catalog are `lib/simulator/referee-match.ts` and
`lib/simulator/referee-cases.ts`. `pnpm test:referee` checks scoring, double-call
protection, grading, count sequencing, live geometry, removal, return eligibility,
symmetry, shuffle coverage and completion of every case in all four variants.
The normal Play engine keeps automatic goal/stall behavior unless referee mode
is explicitly enabled.

## Rules versions

The **Rules version** selector in the header chooses which version of the
rules the whole application works with. The choice is remembered on the device
and is part of every shared link as `ruleset=2026` or `ruleset=2027`. First-time
visitors start with the newest final rules.

| Where                  | What follows the selected version                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rules**              | The official documents of that version, its section numbers, and its situation library. Sections that changed are marked, with a summary above the learning aid.        |
| **Play**               | Field markings of that version, such as the pushing line of the 2027 draft.                                                                                             |
| **Referee**            | The expected calls, robot returns, live incidents, hints, explanations and the cited sections, in Step and in Continuous mode. Changing the version starts a new match. |
| **Version comparison** | Two versions side by side: every change with its old and new wording, what to do differently, how the Lab models it, and situations to practise it.                     |

Under the **2027 draft** the referee engine applies: multiple defense only in a
team's own penalty area; pushing decided by the pushing line; removal as damaged
for ball holding; an out-of-bounds penalty of at least one minute, with the
return at the next game interruption and in the robot's own corner; void goals
only for the penalized robot itself; pushed out for a robot pushed onto the
ramp; waiting robots returned before a lack-of-progress placement; and a
neutral kickoff when no robot is left on the field.

A draft can leave points open. The Lab then needs a working answer, states it
as a **training assumption** in the comparison tab, and keeps it behind a single
setting in `lib/rulesets/2027/gameplay.ts`. For the draft of 2026-09-24 these
are: the position of the pushing line (a copy of the curved white penalty
marking, translated 16 cm towards the goal centreline-to-centreline and clipped
at the goal line; explicitly provisional and not to be drawn on real fields),
the conflict between
sections 2.3 and 2.8 on returning at a kick-off (the changed section 2.8 is
followed), what counts as a game interruption, which own corner a robot returns
to. Returning robots now face their own goal and do not touch white lines.
After a lack-of-progress count, return eligible robots first; if play remains
stuck, move the ball without requiring another count.
Training assumptions are not rules; the final text and the event organizers
decide.

Training certification always uses the 2026 rules. While a certification
round, one of its games or a saved review is open, the selector is locked and
shows that version. Learning progress is shared between versions: situations
keep their id when only their wording changes, and new situations have ids of
their own.

To add a version, follow [adding a rules version](adding-a-rules-version.md).

## Read and explore every rule

Open **Rules** in the top bar, or visit `/?mode=rules`. The contents cover the
complete main Soccer rules, field specification, ball specification, scoring
and judging guidelines, SuperTeam rules, and Entry rules. The federation
conduct policy incorporated by the rules is linked in the contents footer.

The **Situations** library combines the former Explore, Learn and scenario
Referee modes. Each entry opens its official section beside a replay and a
checking question. Multi-step incidents ask each decision in order, including
counts and return requests. Hints support practice, and successful final
answers mark a check as passed. These checks persist separately from reading
progress. **Previous situation** and **Next situation** follow the library;
the rule picker groups alternate situations for the same section. **All rules**
keeps the full document index and technical workbenches available. Existing
scenario links and embeds remain supported.

The official-text pane loads the original document, including every paragraph,
table, note and appendix. It requires internet access and has an **Open original**
link. Each rules version has its own local index with the revision, a content
hash per document and the date it was checked; the reader loads the live
official pages, which may subsequently change. Official paragraphs are not
mirrored into the repository. A notice above the text says when a version is a
draft, or when a published page has a known defect.

- Search section titles and numbers across all six documents. Select a section
  to jump to its official text and corresponding learning tool.
- Use split view, full-width text or the interactive guide. **Reviewed** marks
  persist in this browser. The URL remembers the selected rule and app mode.
- Every subsection of the main gameplay chapter has at least two animations.
  The penalty-area section has five examples covering pushing, ordinary
  contact, multiple defense, combined infringements and goals during pushing.
  Replay, scrub, jump to key moments, change speed/camera, and answer a question.
- The inspection workbench compares Vision and Infrared dimensions, mass,
  capture depth, handle clearance, marker diameter, voltage and radio power.
  Diagrams and limit checks update as measurements change. Its checklist links
  directly to relevant inspection paragraphs.
- The kicker bench compares rebound paths; under the 2027 draft it shows the
  piloted vertical test instead. The field and ball explorers show
  dimensions; the scoring explorer combines tournament placement, actual rubric
  grade choices, TDP bonuses and the Community Award point. Preparation guides
  cover team requirements, documentation, interviews and referee decisions.

The interactive guides are authored learning aids. Waiting periods in animations
may be compressed; the kicker diagram is a geometric illustration, and the
inspection checks do not replace official certification. These guides do not
add automatic enforcement of every rule to Play mode. Competition robots must
operate autonomously.

Entry and SuperTeam retain their own complete documents and format guides;
main-league animations and measurement limits are not applied to those formats.
The reader calls out source differences, including legacy large-ball details
and conflicting poster dimensions. Check event amendments with the organizers.

Learning logic lives in `lib/rulebook`, one folder per rules version in
`lib/rulesets`, and the reader and workbenches in `components/rulebook`. After
an official source update, refresh the heading index of that version and review
the learning aids against the revised text:

```bash
python scripts/sync-rulebook.py 2026
pnpm test:rules
pnpm test:rulesets
```

The sync script indexes headings and counts paragraph/footnote blocks, records
source hashes, and handles duplicate source anchors. It does not generate new
animations or reinterpret changed rules. Tests cover chapter and source
coverage, animation timelines and contact geometry, neutral placements,
inspection boundaries, scoring conversion, search and separate-league routing.

## Embed a situation

Every scenario can be embedded using its stable ID:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://YOUR-SITE/?embed=legal-dribbler-backspin"
  title="Legal dribbler — RCJ Soccer Lab"
  loading="lazy"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>
```

The simulator's **Embed** button copies the current scenario's complete iframe
snippet. Other IDs are exported in `lib/simulator/scenarios.ts`.

## Authoring model

Published rule clips use deterministic sampled transforms so that video,
scrubbing, speed changes, and old rule examples remain stable. A frame can name
one ball owner or no owner; the resolved ball pose is derived from the same
timeline as every robot. Referee choices carry a grade, a normalised score, and
feedback; ambiguous situations can include more than one fully accepted
decision.

Primary specifications:

- [RoboCupJunior Soccer Rules 2026](https://robocup-junior.github.io/soccer-rules/master/rules.html)
- [2026 field specification](https://robocup-junior.github.io/soccer-rules/master/field_specification.html)
- [Open-source 42 mm infrared ball](https://github.com/robocup-junior/ir-golf-ball)

The field constants and derived reference planes are in
`lib/simulator/field-spec.ts`. Normative values follow the written field
specification dated 2026-06-03. Dimensions not fixed by the rules, such as wall
board thickness, follow the accompanying `SoccerField_202605.step` construction
model and are explicitly labelled as construction values.

## Character companions

The optional sideline crew includes Marek, Isa, Tom, Will, Roberto,
David, Jakub, and Caroline. Each has three illustrated poses and fifteen
short fictional lines. A skippable first-visit Rules tour introduces everyone;
**Meet the Characters** reopens it, previews poses, and controls reactions and
motion. Operating-system reduced-motion preferences are always respected.

Companions react to practice quiz answers, rule sections, submitted referee
calls, and public play-mode goals/results. Speaking turns rotate across the
cast, with Isa assigned to damage feedback in practice and Caroline always joining Jakub.
Short queues, timed dismissal, and mute controls keep the panel optional.
During certification, characters acknowledge saved answers and submitted calls
with neutral encouragement, without hints or verdicts. The welcome tour never
opens automatically during an assessment. Live continuous matches also receive
only neutral acknowledgements; saved match reviews do not trigger reactions.
Neither comments nor character selection reveal hidden incidents or correct
answers. Reactions and motion remain optional. Jokes are not real quotations,
official rulings, investment advice, or endorsements; existing sourced
feedback and grading remain authoritative.

All copy is available in English, Slovak, German, and Japanese. The runtime is
entirely static: no image-generation, chat, or paid service is called by the
site. Consent-based generated artwork is in `public/characters/`; original
reference photos are not shipped. `docs/committee-artwork-prompts.json`
records the built-in image generator prompts and the three-column sprite
layout; `docs/committee-artwork-refinements.json` records the final gutter
corrections. `docs/committee-portrait-refresh.json` supersedes the earlier
Jakub and Isa artwork: Jakub wears a black T-shirt with IR-ball, ESP/OLED,
streaming and long-pole props; Isa carries a rulebook with a literal chair.
CSS animates the poses; these are illustrations, not skeletal rigs.
The ivory sprite backgrounds intentionally match the character cards.
Run `pnpm test:committee` for catalogue, fairness, privacy, integration, UI,
translation, and artwork checks.

## Video match reconstruction

The **Video replay** tab opens local match recordings, calibrates fixed camera
views, tracks identified robots/ball, and provides an editable 3D timeline.
Reviewed scores and event notes accompany portable `.rcj-replay.json` files and
silent 720p/1080p video exports. It works without login or a backend.

This is assisted, experimental tracking—not a promise of exact automatic
reconstruction. Occlusions, similar robots, camera changes and side-view
parallax need review. Scoreboard OCR and automatic referee judgments are not
included. See [workflow, limitations and file format](video-reconstruction.md).
Run `pnpm test:reconstruction` for focused regression checks.

## Robot asset pipeline

Browser-ready models live in `public/models/robots`. New designs should ideally
arrive as one resolved, colour-preserving GLB. STEP AP242/AP214 is also suitable:
`scripts/convert-cad-to-glb.py` imports it with CadQuery and
`scripts/prepare-robot-glb.py` uses Blender to correct axes, remove named helper
objects, merge materials, decimate, fit the current 180 mm envelope, and export
a compact GLB. `scripts/inspect-robot-glb.py` reports mesh bounds and materials
for QA.

The 2020 web asset has its single stray CAD triangle removed and its real body
centered and uniformly resized to the same 176 mm width as the 2021 model.
`scripts/repair-2020-robot.py` reproduces that correction from the original
asset, guarded by its source hash. After any mesh change, regenerate
`lib/simulator/robot-footprints.json` using `scripts/extract-robot-footprints.py`
so penalty-area evidence follows the visible body. Number badges sit above
each model's actual height; the shared collision circle contains both bodies.

A folder of individual STL or SolidWorks part files is insufficient when it
does not include assembly occurrence transforms, repeats, and material data.
Export the resolved top-level assembly instead. The selectable CAD mesh is only
the visual layer; robot choice does not change the standard ball attachment
point or any authored rule situation.
